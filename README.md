# Better-Portfolio
An update to my previous portfolio, with more and better information.

Now has a working email link so the user can send me real emails. Linked GitHub and LinkedIn accounts. 

Gave some info on a few projects and the links to the deployed projects and the GitHub repo.

I kept the original layout, as my personal favorite for stuff like this is simplicity.
